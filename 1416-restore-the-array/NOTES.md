1) seen the hint and related topics to make this question
2) we have to create a dp, the dp[i] = number of possible arrays can a string of length i to n can be formed.
3) the biggest hint is length(k) <= 9(so when we create another loop to calculate total values of count of ith - n size string, the total time complexity is 10^6 which can be affordable)
